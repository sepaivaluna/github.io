<p>Clicking on the "Let's Play" button will initialize this game, which will then prompt you an input for you to type your name. <strong><em>WARNING!</em></strong> You must type a name. If you don't have one then make one up.</p>
<p>Once you've got that down, you will be directed to click a couple more buttons before reaching the 'How To Play' screen. On this screen you will see what the winning conditions and also learn a bit more about the cards.</p>
<p>The button on the instructions will then move you to the main game board, and this is where the cards are dealt.</p>
<p>First person to lose their life loses. At the end you will be prompted to reset the board which will take you to the start of the game.</p>

## Approach: 
<p>The approach I used to make this game was a sequence of <em>Pseudocode, CSS, and JQuery</em>. I began writing out all the plans I had to make this game and the daily goals I set myself for completing it.

First, by building the layout with CSS first (with the immense help of Bootstrap), I managed to give myself a good head start into my project. Then, once I had most of my layout completed I began introducing eventListeners for buttons. As I progressed through my project I editted things such as the turns and how the health/alcohol meter would change as the game went on.
